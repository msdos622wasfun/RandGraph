# RandGraph
 Random number distribution graphing program.

This is a program written in Aurora, which is a language by Ionic Wind Software that is kind of a cross between C and BASIC.

I like it a lot and was looking for an excuse to write something with it, and poof, this program was born.

RandGraph is nothing more than a very simple utility that will pick random numbers from 1 to 10 for as many repetitions as defined by the user.

It will then display the results at the end, or even in real-time if so desired (with totals along with a makeshift bar chart).

The app uses console mode.  There's one annoying thing I couldn't fix: I wasn't able to disable the cursor (you'll see what I mean).

Although one of the features of Aurora is that it supposedly can access the Windows API, I did not find anything about that in the documentation, and there is no built-in function to turn the cursor off.

Also keep in mind one thing: if you type in the maximum number of random numbers possible, be prepared to wait a long time.  (You can always abort.)
